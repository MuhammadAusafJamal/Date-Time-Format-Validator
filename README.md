# Date-Time Format Validator

## Overview
This repository contains a **Date-Time Format Validator**, developed as the final project for Semester 5 in the course **BSCS-501: Theory of Computation**. This project focuses on validating various formats of date and time using **JavaScript**. The user interface is built with **Bootstrap**, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design.

The project demonstrates the practical application of computational theory concepts and JavaScript's ability to handle complex regular expressions for pattern matching. It includes validation for multiple date and time formats.
